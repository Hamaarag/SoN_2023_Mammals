Analyses of all Mammal units except for Batha - which is in the folder "Ella units"
output folder - all figs. (each unit has it's own folder) + outputs from mvabund models
data folder - data used for script and other output tables + summaries + coeff tables
functions folder - all functions used for mammal analyses
All figures are ready for publication
functions folder includes functions for effect_plot and interact_plot after fitting for mammal data 
(meaning x axis scale back calculated from time difference/rescale distance from agricultre/rescaled distance from settlement)
Also, I made seperate function files for forest + maquis units because they were sampled on uneven years 
so the x scale needed to be different for figs that include the time variable
data table used for all units is - mammals.abundance.matrix.TG.csv
data table used for scientific names is - Scientific.names.mammals.xlsx
